# Missile-Target Engagement Simulation

This is a simulation of the terminal homing phase of a missile - target planar engagement utilizing proportional navigation guidance law. The missile dynamics are iterated through time using the Runge-Kutta 4th order integration method.

## Known Bugs:
1. Unable to visually display charts using matplotlib-python conversion

## Future Project Milestones:
1. Modularize code
2. Create in both C++ and Python
3. Implement Kalman filtering
4. Implement Monte Carlo varying mass and inertia
